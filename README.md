Replace /path/to/input/directory and /path/to/output/directory with the actual paths to your input and output directories. Also, adjust the codec and crf settings according to your preferences.

This script will find all video files with extensions .mp4, .mkv, and .avi in the specified input directory and its subdirectories. It will then re-encode each video using the specified codec and CRF settings, saving the output files in the specified output directory with the same directory structure as the input.

Remember to make the script executable using the command: chmod +x script.sh.
